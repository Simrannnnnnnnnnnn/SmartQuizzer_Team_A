## 🔬 Difficulty Calculation & Feature Logic

SmartQuizzer doesn't just "guess" the difficulty; it uses a mathematical approach to determine the user's **Knowledge Coefficient ($K_c$)**.

### 📐 The Formula
The next difficulty level is calculated using the following weighted average formula:

$$D_{next} = \frac{(A \times W_a) + (S \times W_s) + (H \times W_h)}{\sum W}$$

**Where:**
* $A$: **Accuracy Score** (0.0 - 1.0)
* $S$: **Semantic Depth** (How well the theory answer matches the core concept)
* $H$: **Historical Mastery** (Past performance on this specific topic)
* $W$: **Weightage constants** assigned to each parameter.

---

### 🛠️ Adaptive Feature Integration
Our core features are directly tied to this calculation. Depending on the $D_{next}$ output, the system toggles specific AI modules:

| Feature | Trigger Logic | Implementation |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **🧠 ELI10 Module** | Triggered when $K_c < 0.5$ | AI rewrites complex jargon into "Explain Like I'm 10" analogies to fix foundational gaps. |
| **📜 Mnemonic Hub** | High error rate in fact-retention | System generates custom acronyms and stories to aid memory palace techniques. |
| **🔍 Expert OCR** | Initial Ingestion Phase | Sanitizes handwritten or image-based text to ensure the AI has 100% clean context. |
| **📑 Shorthand Notes** | Post-Quiz Analysis | Generates "Quick-Ref" bullet points focused only on the questions the user got wrong. |

---

### ⚙️ Evaluation Weightage Matrix
When a user submits a theory-based answer, the **AI Evaluation Engine** applies the following weights to calculate the Semantic Depth ($S$):

| Criteria | Weight | Purpose |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Semantic Match** | `40%` | Ensures the core meaning is correct, even if wording differs. |
| **Keyword Density** | `25%` | Checks for essential technical or subject-specific terminology. |
| **Logical Flow** | `20%` | Validates the "Cause and Effect" structure of the answer. |
| **Completeness** | `15%` | Checks if all sub-parts of the question were addressed. |

---
---

## 🔬 AI Evaluation System

The evaluation engine utilizes a **Semantic Grading Logic** powered by Llama 3.3. Instead of looking for exact word matches, the system evaluates the **conceptual integrity** of the user's response.

### 🔄 Evaluation Process Flow
The grading lifecycle follows a rigorous four-step validation process:

1. **Extraction:** The system identifies core "Knowledge Nodes" within the correct answer.
2. **Comparison:** The user’s input is vectorized and compared against the Knowledge Nodes.
3. **Deduction:** Points are deducted for logical fallacies, contradictions, or missing dependencies.
4. **Synthesis:** A final weighted score is generated along with constructive, actionable feedback.

---

### 📏 Evaluation Criteria Matrix
The following matrix defines the weightage assigned to different aspects of a user's answer.

| Criteria | Weight | Technical Definition | Failure Trigger |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Semantic Match** | `40%` | Measures the alignment of the core meaning/concept. | Using correct words but in a logically incorrect order. |
| **Keyword Density** | `25%` | Presence of essential technical terms and nomenclature. | Using overly vague language or "layman" filler words. |
| **Logical Flow** | `20%` | Validates the "Cause & Effect" or sequential reasoning. | Skipping critical steps in a process or methodology. |
| **Completeness** | `15%` | Checks if all sub-parts of the prompt were addressed. | Providing a correct but "partial" answer to a multi-part question. |

---

### 💹 Scoring Tier Logic

| Score Range | Mastery Tier | System Action |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **90% - 100%** | 🏆 **Expert** | Confirms mastery; unlocks advanced "Deep Dive" topics. |
| **70% - 89%** | 🥈 **Proficient** | Identifies minor gaps; suggests specific "Shorthand" review. |
| **50% - 69%** | 🥉 **Intermediate** | Triggers **Mnemonic Generation** to assist with retention. |
| **< 50%** | ⚠️ **Beginner** | Forces **ELI10 Mode** to rebuild foundational understanding. |

---
---

## 💬 AI Feedback Generation System

SmartQuizzer doesn't just grade; it instructs. Our feedback system acts as a virtual tutor, translating raw scores into actionable study advice to ensure every mistake becomes a learning opportunity.

### 🔄 Feedback Generation Pipeline
The AI analyzes the "gap" between the user's input and the source content using a three-step cognitive check:

1. **Gap Identification:** AI compares the user's response vectors against the "Ideal Knowledge Nodes" extracted during ingestion.
2. **Contextual Framing:** The feedback is framed using **Scaffolding Theory**—providing enough hints to help the user find the answer without giving it away immediately.
3. **Actionable Redirection:** Every response concludes with a specific "Next Step" (e.g., "Review Mnemonic #3" or "Switch to ELI10 Mode").

---

### 📋 Feedback Criteria & Tier Logic
The feedback style dynamically shifts based on the **Semantic Score** calculated by the evaluation engine:

| Score Tier | Feedback Mode | Content Strategy | Example AI Response |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **90-100%** | 🌟 **Reinforcement** | Confirms mastery and introduces an advanced "Expert Fact." | *"Spot on! You've mastered the core logic. Did you know this also connects to [Advanced Concept]?"* |
| **70-89%** | 💡 **Refinement** | Validates the logic but corrects specific technical terminology. | *"Your logic is sound, but try using the term 'Isothermal' instead of 'Steady Heat' for better precision."* |
| **50-69%** | 🔍 **Correction** | Identifies the specific logical "missing link" or dependency. | *"You understood the 'What' but missed the 'Why'. Re-read the 2nd paragraph of your Shorthand Notes."* |
| **< 50%** | ⚠️ **Redirection** | Breaks the concept down into an **ELI10** analogy immediately. | *"Let's simplify: Think of a CPU like a chef in a kitchen. You're missing how the 'Orders' (Data) are stored."* |

---

### 🛠️ Feedback UI Components
The user interacts with this feedback through three primary touchpoints:

* **Real-time Toasts:** Instant "Correct/Incorrect" indicators with brief logic snippets.
* **"Deconstruct My Answer" Button:** An optional deep-dive modal that explains the **Semantic Matrix (40/25/20/15)** scoring for that specific question.
* **Study Path Suggestions:** Found on the **Result Screen**, these are deep-links that take the user back to the specific part of the **Study Hub** they struggled with.

## 🔮 Future Roadmap: The Path to v3.0

SmartQuizzer is evolving from a quiz generator into a fully autonomous AI tutor. Below are the key milestones in our development pipeline:

### 🛠️ Phase 1: Enhanced Interactivity (Short-term)
- [ ] **Voice Hub v2:** Integration with Whisper and TTS (Text-to-Speech) for hands-free "Viva-style" verbal examinations.
- [ ] **Collaborative Hubs:** Allow multiple users to join a "Study Room" and compete on the same AI-generated material in real-time.
- [ ] **PDF Export Portal:** One-click generation of beautifully formatted PDF study guides containing your personalized Mnemonics and Shorthand notes.

### 🧠 Phase 2: Cognitive Deepening (Mid-term)
- [ ] **Spaced Repetition System (SRS):** An automated notification system that prompts users to re-take quizzes exactly when the **Retention Decay** logic predicts they are about to forget.
- [ ] **Browser Extension:** A "Smart-Highlight" tool to generate instant 5-question quizzes from any technical article or documentation page while browsing.
- [ ] **Multi-Modal Mastery:** Support for video-link ingestion—convert YouTube educational videos into interactive assessments.

### 📊 Phase 3: Advanced Analytics (Long-term)
- [ ] **Global Benchmarking:** Anonymous data comparison to show how your **Knowledge Velocity** compares to the global average for specific topics.
- [ ] **Predictive AI:** Based on your historical "Gap Analysis," the AI will predict which topics you are likely to struggle with in future related modules.
- [ ] **Teacher Dashboard:** A specialized interface for educators to track the "Classroom Heatmap" and identify collective knowledge gaps in a group of students.
